# Speed Dating
Final project for STAT 845 - Classification at University of Waterloo

## Steps to run R code

* Download the dataset (<i>speeddating.csv</i> file) from https://www.openml.org/data/get_csv/13153954/speeddating.arff.
* We have the whole code as a single file - <i>code.Rmd</i>. Open <i>code.Rmd</i> and update the path to the dataset file <i>speeddating.csv</i>.
* Make sure you have all the below mentioned packages installed
  * fmsb
  * dplyr
  * plyr
  * tibble
  * stringr
  * ggplot2
  * grid
  * gridBase
  * scales
  * ggplot2
  * gridExtra
  * grid
  * reshape2
  * glmnet
  * MASS
  * klaR
  * randomForest
  * e1071
  * nnet
  * xgboost (needs RTools which is only available for R version > 3.6)
  * sm
  * FNN
* Now you can either run individual cells or knit the whole <i>code.Rmd</i> file to produce a pdf with the results.
